      <h3>
        After 4 challenging weeks, learning how to program from complete
        scratch, we were able to make this project together.
        <p>
          Right from the start, before even knowing what project we would build,
          we decided that we were gonna do something that was practical,
          challenging and something that somehow provided some value to the
          community in general
        </p>
        <p>
          There's still a lot of work that needs to be done in order for this
          project to fulfill our inicial objective but we are confident that we
          will get it done!
        </p>
